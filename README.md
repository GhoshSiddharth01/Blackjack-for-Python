# Blackjack-for-Python
Blackjack repository
Lets hope this README works. It's my first time doing any of this. Except programming. I have a little experience in programming. 

This project is a blackjack game on python. It follows the same basic rules of the game. 
The user faces the program in the game.

The "bot" that the user is against will only hit if it has a low enough value of cards, and will only stay if it has a high enough value. 
The bot can bust, and the bot can stay. 
It is a one player game (might work on making it two player or best out of 5, not sure yet)

Feel free to give constructive criticism and/or edit/add to the design!
